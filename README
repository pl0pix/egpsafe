egpsafe -- Eriks Gpg Password Safe

Motivation
 The goal of this script is to store passwords in a file without any format
and keep it as secure as possible. This means gpg encrypted. It must still
work, if most other things on a host do not work anymore. This means: egpsafe
should have least possible dependencies. That's why it has a command line 
interface and no gui.

Features
 • depends only on bash and gpg (in offline mode)
 • mutiple gpg recipients possible. eg. you have seperate keys for work/private
 • sync password safe to hup (adds a dependency to ssh)
 • uses wipe if TMPFILE is located on a harddrive

Modes
 • offline (default) no synchronisation happens. submodes: edit/see/search
 • online/merge sync in either direction: hup or spoke
